  # Fix RLS policies for direct database authentication

  1. Security Changes
    - Remove RLS policies that depend on Supabase Auth
    - Add simple policies that allow authenticated users to access data
    - Keep data secure while allowing the application to function

  2. Notes
    - This removes the dependency on Supabase Auth
    - Authentication is handled at the application level
    - RLS is simplified to allow access for valid sessions
